# gladePrologue

This was my first RPG game, created with the enchant.js library. It includes standard map navigation and cutscenes.

It is now outdated - web standards are constantly changing, while enchant.js is not, leading to new bugs. 

Two innovative features:
1. The "clue system," which is the main impetus behind the game. Players can collect clues and combine them using logical deduction to create new clues.
2. The NPC conversation system. Rather than using simple messages or branching dialog, NPC conversation is based on a collection of keywords, to which different characters give different answers.

As my first RPG, this was rather rough, as can be seen in the JavaScript. I corrected the more annoying features in the sequel, which is filed in GitHub under glade1.

Playable version: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/645734. Warning: since it is no longer receiving enchant.js updates, it may at some point in the future stop working. It did this once already, about a year after I posted it.
